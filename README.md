# EV Population Data Preprocessing

## Overview  
This repository contains a preprocessing pipeline for the **Electric Vehicle Population dataset**. It includes essential data preparation steps such as cleaning, normalization, transformation, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality, structured data for further analysis and machine learning applications.  

## Features  
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- ✅ **Data Normalization**: Scaling and transforming features for better model performance.  
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful insights from raw data.  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding dataset patterns and distributions.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset consists of information about electric vehicles, including specifications, registration details, and demographic insights.  
- It is used for research, analysis, and predictive modeling.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Usage
